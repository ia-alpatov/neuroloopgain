# EDF/EDF+ reader library - NeuroloopGain


This project is a C# implementation of the NeuroLoopGain analyzer for EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram) signals.

It is based on the mathematical derivations and specifications in the article "Analysis of a sleep-dependent neuronal feedback loop: the slow-wave microcontinuity of the EEG" by B Kemp B, AH Zwinderman, B Tuk, HAC Kamphuisen and JJL Obery√© in IEEE-BME 47(9), 2000: 1185-1194.

The analyzer accepts EEG signals in EDF/EDF+ formatted files and includes a library to handle those files.
